# News Evaluate Project

## Overview
Fourth project in the Udacity Nanodegree Program "Front End Developer".

## Project Requirements/Tasks
Purpose of this project was to get more experience of working with buildtools (Webpack), node.js and API's. In this project we are supposed to work with webpack when we create a website that uses the Aylien API. The criteria was:

1. Be set up with Webpack, Express, Node, and Sass, and Service Workers

2. Have separate dev and prod configurations for Webpack

3. Have the developer environment set up with the Webpack dev server

4. Have a minimum of one form field

5. Make one request to the Aylien API

6. Use Sass for styling

7. Minify js and styles in the production environment

8. Response from the API must be added to the view for a user to see 

9. Be able to show content offline

## Instructions

1. Locate yourself to the root project folder and install all the dependencies by using 'npm install'

2. Start the server by running the command 'npm run start' in the terminal.

3. Go to website localhost:8080.

4. Paste in the article of your choice in the form and press submit, and you'll see the response from the API being viewed.

Note: Purpose of this project was mostly to work on new achievied node.js, API and build-tools skills, and not css and javascript. Therefore not much time was put into styling.
